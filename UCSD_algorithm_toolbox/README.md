week 1: maximum pair wise product
the key idea is that the maximum product is actually the product of the first two largest numbers
but a few common mistakes
1. int type is not enough and may cause overflow when number is large
2. use sort and take the first two largest numbers makes the algorithm much more efficient, nlog(n) cost
